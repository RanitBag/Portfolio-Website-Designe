             <p>Hello and welcome.My name is Jayanta Hore, and I am a certified yoga teacher. My journey with yoga started 10 years ago when I was looking for a way to manage stress and improve my overall health and well-being.

                Through consistent practice, I experienced the transformative power of yoga, both physically and mentally. This inspired me to deepen my practice and become a teacher so I could share the benefits of yoga with others.
                
                As a teacher, I am dedicated to creating a safe and supportive environment for my students to explore their practice. I believe that yoga is for everybody, regardless of age, fitness level, or experience.
                
                My teaching style is a blend of traditional Hatha yoga with elements of Vinyasa flow. I encourage my students to focus on their breath and move mindfully through each pose, cultivating a deeper connection between body, mind, and spirit.
                
                In my classes, you can expect a balance of strength-building, flexibility, and relaxation, with an emphasis on proper alignment and modifications to accommodate individual needs.
                
                I am committed to continuing my education and staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the yoga world so that I can provide my students with the best possible experience.
                
                Whether you are new to yoga or a seasoned practitioner, I look forward to practicing with you and helping you discover the many benefits of this ancient practice.</p>
